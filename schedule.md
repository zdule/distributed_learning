## Description
Re-implement the Horovod data distributed parallel training method
### Requirements:
- Understand Horovod and ring all-reduce
- Find a suitable frame-work with distributed computing
- Get some HW to run the project on => Cambridge CSD3
- Basic implementation
### Stretch Goals:
- Pipelining
- Tensor Fusion

## Schedule
### Dec 7 - Dec 13
- Understand basic concepts 
- Look into TF distributed (DZ)
- Look into PyTorch distributed (VT)
- Create repo (DZ)

Settled on Pytorch, TF looked much more mystic

### Dec 14 - Dec 20
- Look into Uni's computing cluster (DZ)
- Implement a basic distributed app in PT (VT)

### Dec 21 - Jan 3
- XMAS!!!!
- Create basic DPP training and ring all-reduce in PT (VT)
- Get some laptops to test locally (VT)

Basic Horovod now runs on local machines

### Jan 4 - Jan 10
- Start writing report (VT)
- Look into HPC infra (DZ)
- Pipelining (DZ)

### Jan 11 - Jan 17
- Work on report (VT)
- Tensor Fusion (DZ)
- Run it on HPC (DZ)

Extra features are working remarkably well

### Jan 18 - Jan 20
- Run final experiments (DZ, VT)
- Finish report (DZ, VT)
- ....
- Profit!
